<h2>Megan Grubaugh</h2>
<p>I am a graphic design and web development major. I have only recently discovered my passion for graphic design and am trying my hand at web development to expand my opportunities in this wonderful area of work. I have been married for four years to my wonderful husband Kirt Noble who is a chemistry major at BYU. We have two wonderful cats named Stormy and Shadow who are my current place holders for children until we are ready for that part of life.</p>
