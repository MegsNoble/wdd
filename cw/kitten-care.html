    <h3>Kitten Care</h3>
    <h2>How to help your cat settle into their new home and family.</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a very difficult, but important process. If you were anything like me when I got my first cat, you are ecstatic to show your new furry friend to their home. Unfortunately, I will have to ask you to pump your brakes. First things first, choose one room to keep your new cat in. It should be smaller in size but have enough room to set a litter box, food bowl, and water bowl in different areas of the room. This will be the room they will first be acclimated to. (This also helps if you already have another cat within the home. If you do have two cats, the cats should not be introduced face to face right away. This is for the safety of both cats and yourself.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have your cat room set up, feel free to sit in the room with them. Let them explore and smell both you and their new environment. Be sure to have a few small toys available for them to play with. These processes shouldnâ€™t take too long. Once your new cat seems used to the first room (perhaps after 24 hours within the room), feel free to open the door and let them room some more of the house. If you have another cat in the house, the acclimation process might take a bit longer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are specific steps to introducing cats to each other. Keeping one in the cat room you have set up is good to allow the cats to smell each other from under the door. They should play with each other by pawing underneath the door. Once that step is done, some cats may need more time and effort to introduce to each other, and you should make it so the cats can see and smell each other, but still have a barrier to keep them apart. Once this step is normalized, you can begin removing the barrier but ensure the cats meeting is under supervision. If the cats seem fine with each other, they can continue on in this step until they no longer need supervision. If the cats are still having difficulties, make the meetings short and place the cats in separate areas between these meetings. Another important part in this step is to let the cats switch rooms so the new cat can get used to the rest of the house and the small of your other cat. This will also allow your previous cat to get used to the scent of your new cat. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, at the end of this step, both your cats should be acclimated to each other and can live with each other with no issues. Obviously, there can be exceptions. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        Good luck, be patient, and love your cat(s)!
