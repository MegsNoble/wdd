        Pets are often referred to as our babies. Although they are known as aloof and very independent, many cats actually beg for attention and love. Most cat owners are aware of this sweet secret. Unfortunately, because of the misunderstanding of cats, many new adoptive owners are surprised by their new fur babies. I too found myself in this position not too long ago. It was a bit overwhelming finding out that throughout my whole life, I had been taught that cats don’t need lots of help. You just put out food, a litter box, and they take care of the rest; or so I thought. I personally had to do lots of research for my fur babies to ensure I gave them the most loving home I could. Therefore, I present this website to try and help decrease the time that this information took for me to find. Please enjoy.

        If you are deciding to adopt a cat - Choose your breed carefully. 
      </p>
      <p>Shockingly, like dogs, breeds are deeply important when trying to decide what type of cat to get. It is recommended that you do some prior research before adopting your new kitten. Like dogs, cats also have breeds that are more playful, more lazy, more loving, more aggressive, more shy, more territorial, etc. Along with the breed, the gender of your cat can greatly determine their behavior and how they fit in your family. I have met many individuals who assumed that the behavior of a female cat would be sweeter, and a male cat would be more aggressive. Sorry to disappoint, but often it is the other way around. Obviously, this is a very general statement because both male and female cats can be sweet or aggressive, but doing research on the breed and gender might reveal some surprising facts. Once again, I encourage you to choose the breed and gender of your cat wisely in order to find the best fit for your family. Although, if you have already adopted a cat without knowing about their behaviors based on breed and gender, don’t fret. You can learn how to best train and care for your cat so you can encourage good behaviors and discourage otherwise unfavorable behaviors. Please feel free to visit the Kitten Care link at the top of the page.

      <h3>Kitten Care</h3>
      <p>How to help your cat settle into their new home and family.

      </p>
      <p>
        This is a very difficult, but important process. If you were anything like me when I got my first cat, you are ecstatic to show your new furry friend to their home. Unfortunately, I will have to ask you to pump your brakes. First things first, choose one room to keep your new cat in. It should be smaller in size but have enough room to set a litter box, food bowl, and water bowl in different areas of the room. This will be the room they will first be acclimated to. (This also helps if you already have another cat within the home. If you do have two cats, the cats should not be introduced face to face right away. This is for the safety of both cats and yourself.) Once you have your cat room set up, feel free to sit in the room with them. Let them explore and smell both you and their new environment. Be sure to have a few small toys available for them to play with. These processes shouldn’t take too long. Once your new cat seems used to the first room (perhaps after 24 hours within the room), feel free to open the door and let them room some more of the house. If you have another cat in the house, the acclimation process might take a bit longer. There are specific steps to introducing cats to each other. Keeping one in the cat room you have set up is good to allow the cats to smell each other from under the door. They should play with each other by pawing underneath the door. Once that step is done, some cats may need more time and effort to introduce to each other, and you should make it so the cats can see and smell each other, but still have a barrier to keep them apart. Once this step is normalized, you can begin removing the barrier but ensure the cats meeting is under supervision. If the cats seem fine with each other, they can continue on in this step until they no longer need supervision. If the cats are still having difficulties, make the meetings short and place the cats in separate areas between these meetings. Another important part in this step is to let the cats switch rooms so the new cat can get used to the rest of the house and the small of your other cat. This will also allow your previous cat to get used to the scent of your new cat. Eventually, at the end of this step, both your cats should be acclimated to each other and can live with each other with no issues. Obviously, there can be exceptions.

      <h3>Can't Sleep?</h3>
      <p>
        Many cat owners can find themselves struggling to get sleep. This is a very common challenge to have. There are many different possible reasons for this, so here are some reasons and solutions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They want attention! -
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure that you have not trained your cat to meow to get your attention. If this is the issue, you may have a few difficult nights and days of sleep to correct this behavior. You have to ignore your cat’s meows. Make them recognize you won’t respond to that type of behavior. Obviously, this does not include meows of pain or fear. Once you have made sure that your cat understands this, you can refer to the section “Your cat is bored or lonely!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Your cat feels unsafe -
      </p>
      <p>
        Your cat may feel like its territory is being compromised. They may not be happy with their litter. They may need more perches to give them a better view of their surroundings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your cat may be in pain -
      </p>
      <p>
        Observe them. See if they show any discomfort. If you notice something or have tried everything else to help your cat stay quiet, take the to a vet. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your cat is bored or lonely! -
      </p>
      <p> 
        Like dogs, cats need play time! For most cat breeds, play time may only mean 15 – 30 minutes of exercise. For others, they may need much more. It is important to get your cat out of breath when you play with them. Make sure to wear them out. This should help them rest throughout the night. If that is still not enough, invest in some interactive toys. There are some toys that will activate due to movement or sound which will help keep them entertained when you are not there to do so. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your cat needs something -
      </p>
      <p>
        They may need food or water at certain times throughout the night. This may be solved by using a water fountain and automatic feeder. Your cat may not like their litter or litter box. Try a different litter or litter box. If not that, perhaps their litter just needs to be cleaned more often. They may also need a reliable schedule. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have gotten a very verbal cat -
      </p>
      <p>
        In very rare circumstances, you may have gotten a chatty cat. In this case, you may have done all of the things above, and your cat still won’t stop meowing. You may want to invest in some ear plugs, some comfy headphones that you can listen to music with as you sleep. I pray for you and wish you the best of luck as you deal with this challenge!
