        Welcome to the cat help hub! 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Pets are often referred to as our babies. Although they are known as aloof and very independent, many cats actually beg for attention and love. Most cat owners are aware of this sweet secret. Unfortunately, because of the misunderstanding of cats, many new adoptive owners are surprised by their new fur babies. I too found myself in this position not too long ago. It was a bit overwhelming finding out that throughout my whole life, I had been taught that cats don’t need lots of help. You just put out food, a litter box, and they take care of the rest; or so I thought. I personally had to do lots of research for my fur babies to ensure I gave them the most loving home I could. Therefore, I present this website to try and help decrease the time that this information took for me to find. Please enjoy.

    <h2>
        If you are deciding to adopt a cat - Choose your breed carefully. 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Shockingly, like dogs, breeds are deeply important when trying to decide what type of cat to get. It is recommended that you do some prior research before adopting your new kitten. Like dogs, cats also have breeds that are more playful, more lazy, more loving, more aggressive, more shy, more territorial, etc. Along with the breed, the gender of your cat can greatly determine their behavior and how they fit in your family. I have met many individuals who assumed that the behavior of a female cat would be sweeter, and a male cat would be more aggressive. Sorry to disappoint, but often it is the other way around. Obviously, this is a very general statement because both male and female cats can be sweet or aggressive, but doing research on the breed and gender might reveal some surprising facts. Once again, I encourage you to choose the breed and gender of your cat wisely in order to find the best fit for your family. Although, if you have already adopted a cat without knowing about their behaviors based on breed and gender, don’t fret. You can learn how to best train and care for your cat so you can encourage good behaviors and discourage otherwise unfavorable behaviors. Please feel free to visit the Kitten Care link at the top of the page.
