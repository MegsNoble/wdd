    <h3>Can't Sleep?</h3>
    <p>
      Many cat owners can find themselves struggling to get sleep. This is a very common challenge to have. There are many different possible reasons for this, so here are some reasons and solutions. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      They want attention! -
    </h2>
    <p>
      Make sure that you have not trained your cat to meow to get your attention. If this is the issue, you may have a few difficult nights and days of sleep to correct this behavior. You have to ignore your cat’s meows. Make them recognize you won’t respond to that type of behavior. Obviously, this does not include meows of pain or fear. Once you have made sure that your cat understands this, you can refer to the section “Your cat is bored or lonely!”
    </p>
    <h2>
      Your cat feels unsafe -
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your cat may feel like its territory is being compromised. They may not be happy with their litter. They may need more perches to give them a better view of their surroundings. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Your cat may be in pain -
    </h2>
    <p>
      Observe them. See if they show any discomfort. If you notice something or have tried everything else to help your cat stay quiet, take the to a vet. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Your cat is bored or lonely! -
    </h2>
    <p> 
      Like dogs, cats need play time! For most cat breeds, play time may only mean 15 – 30 minutes of exercise. For others, they may need much more. It is important to get your cat out of breath when you play with them. Make sure to wear them out. This should help them rest throughout the night. If that is still not enough, invest in some interactive toys. There are some toys that will activate due to movement or sound which will help keep them entertained when you are not there to do so. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Your cat needs something -
    </h2>
    <p>
      They may need food or water at certain times throughout the night. This may be solved by using a water fountain and automatic feeder. Your cat may not like their litter or litter box. Try a different litter or litter box. If not that, perhaps their litter just needs to be cleaned more often. They may also need a reliable schedule. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      You may have gotten a very verbal cat -
    </h2>
    <p>
      In very rare circumstances, you may have gotten a chatty cat. In this case, you may have done all of the things above, and your cat still won’t stop meowing. You may want to invest in some ear plugs, some comfy headphones that you can listen to music with as you sleep. I pray for you and wish you the best of luck as you deal with this challenge! 
    </p>
    <h3>
        Good luck, be patient, and love your cat(s)!
    </h3>
